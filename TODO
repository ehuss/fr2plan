TODO:
- test move loading/compression

- history traversal back to where "level" is not set should clear the level.
- Fix background colors.
- Some way to indicate which tower is currently selected?
- Prettify.
- Footer?
- button to add rounds (endless/challenges/etc)
- maybe use translation for animation instead of fade

Advanced:
- differentiate trenches/background
- select towers first (with animation!)
- save layout
- show runner path
- handle levels that already have towers
- undo
- keep track of cash spent, and maximum available cash per level
- Add a number to the tower images indicating the level.
- Show numbers on towers indicating sequence numbers?

Missing towers:
- machine gun
- sonic blast
- slow link
- cannon
- gas
- link
- plague
- zap
- power
