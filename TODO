TODO:
- Add width/height to img's.
- test move loading/compression

- add version numbers to the JS to deal with caching.
- history traversal back to where "level" is not set should clear the level.
- Fix background colors.
- Prettify.
- Footer?
- maybe use translation for animation instead of fade
- Make level links real links instead of onclicks?
- "undoing" a move seems to polute the move data (makes the move URL longer).
- drag and drop on an existing tower should replace, not upgrade

Advanced:
- select towers first (with animation!)
- save layout
- show runner path
- handle levels that already have towers
- undo
- keep track of cash spent, and maximum available cash per level
- Add a number to the tower images indicating the level.
- Show numbers on towers indicating sequence numbers?
- Show bridges/restricted running directions/etc.

Missing towers:
- gas
- plague
- zap
- power
